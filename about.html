        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Ravina Marilyn Banze, and I am deeply passionate about utilizing data analytics and computational social sciences to drive positive change. I am a current Master's student in Data Analytics and Computational Social Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I possess a solid foundation in analyzing complex data sets and deriving valuable insights. My main focus lies in making a meaningful impact in the fields of crowdfunding, social impact startups, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
        <p>I have gained extensive experience and expertise through my various roles and entrepreneurial endeavors. As the co-founder and CEO of CrowdHive, a reward-based crowdfunding platform, I successfully created a platform dedicated to supporting social impact startups and small businesses. Overseeing strategy, research, community building, and team management, I have led CrowdHive in establishing valuable partnerships and making a tangible difference in the lives of entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>During my tenure as the co-founder and CEO of Project Nile, a bootstrapped startup providing research and crowdfunding consulting, I had the opportunity to make a significant impact in the nonprofit sector. I conceptualized and developed the curriculum for Project Nile's crowdfunding fellowship program, training and empowering 200 fellows in nonprofit fundraising. Additionally, I advised numerous NGOs on their volunteering, fundraising, and digital transformation strategies, fostering collaborations between local governments, educational institutions, and corporations.</p>
        <p>My journey also led me to serve as a primary data analyst at SEWA, where I crafted a comprehensive Data Strategy Framework by conducting qualitative research. I played a crucial role in upgrading and redesigning digital and mobile tools for data collection, and I performed exploratory and descriptive analysis to identify key trends and correlations. Leveraging my expertise in machine learning algorithms, I deployed predictive analytics models to generate valuable insights from agriculture data.</p>
        <p>In addition to my professional endeavors, I have actively engaged in volunteering, mentoring, and leadership roles. I have coordinated volunteering programs, spearheaded CSR initiatives, and developed impactful CSR programs focusing on women empowerment, road safety, water-sanitation, and the environment. My dedication to making a difference extends beyond my work, as I have continuously sought opportunities to contribute to social causes and create a positive impact in society.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am driven by my passion for data analytics and my commitment to making a difference in the social sector. Through my academic qualifications, diverse experiences, and leadership roles, I strive to harness the power of data-driven insights to create a better world.</p>
