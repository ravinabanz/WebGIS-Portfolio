            <h3>1. Resume in HTML</h3>
            <p>During this project, I gained valuable skills in creating a resume using HTML. I delved into the world of HTML and explored its various features and functionalities. It allowed me to experiment with different colors, designs, and layouts to make my resume visually appealing and unique. By working on this project, I not only honed my HTML skills but also developed a better understanding of web design principles. This experience enabled me to showcase my creativity and attention to detail, ensuring that my resume stands out from the rest and leaves a lasting impression on potential employers. </p>
